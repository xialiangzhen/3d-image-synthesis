# 3d-image-synthesis
This project is a computer graphic course project for the whole semester of 2016 Spring. It is to draw virtual 3D objects with real but artistic view. 
The main process of the rendering is: 1. diffuse shading; 2 specular highlight; 3 boundary color; 4 shadow.  
The objects could be the quadric functions such as spheres, cylinders, planes or import from ".obj" files with triangular mesh.
The light source could be parallel, point or spot light with area. 
The main effects realized are: shaped specular highlight, texture mapping, solid texture, reflection, refraction, translucent, out of focus, motion blur, glossy, soft shadow, normal mapping(make texture more convincing), 2d or 3d function texture, Julia set etc.
The rendering outcomes are in the file of "snapshot".
